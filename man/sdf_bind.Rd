\title{Bind multiple Spark DataFrames by row and column}
\usage{
sdf_bind_rows(..., id = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{...}{Spark tbls to combine.

  Each argument can either be a Spark DataFrame or a list of
  Spark DataFrames

  When row-binding, columns are matched by name, and any missing
  columns with be filled with NA.

  When column-binding, rows are matched by position, so all data
  frames must have the same number of rows. To match by value, not
  position, see [join].}

\item{id}{Data frame identifier.

  When `id` is supplied, a new column of identifiers is
  created to link each row to its original Spark DataFrame. The labels
  are taken from the named arguments to `bind_rows()`. When a
  list of Spark DataFrames is supplied, the labels are taken from the
  names of the list. If no names are found a numeric sequence is
  used instead.}
}
\value{
\code{sdf_bind_rows()} and \code{sdf_bind_cols()} return \code{tbl_spark}
}
\description{
\code{sdf_bind_rows()} and \code{sdf_bind_cols()} are implementation of the common pattern of
`do.call(rbind, sdfs)` or `do.call(cbind, sdfs)` for binding many
Spark DataFrames into one.
}
\details{
The output of \code{sdf_bind_rows()} will contain a column if that column
appears in any of the inputs.
